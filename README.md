# Poetry Assistant for Rhyme Suggestions ✍️

## Introduction
The Poetry Assistant is designed to help users discover rhymes effortlessly. By leveraging algorithms to suggest both single (masculine) and assonance rhymes, the assistant enhances creativity and speeds up the poetic writing process. The project focuses on providing accurate rhyme suggestions based on syllable structure and sorting techniques, ensuring a smooth user experience for poets and lyricists.

## Learning and Development
This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of advanced JavaScript concepts, data structures, and algorithmic design. Node.js was utilised to create a robust backend for rhyme generation, enabling efficient server-side processing. I designed custom rhyme-sorting algorithms and implemented stacks, arrays, and linked lists to manage rhyme data dynamically.

## Features & Functions
### Rhyme Algorithms
- **Single (Masculine) Rhyme**: Utilises a stack-based algorithm to find and suggest exact end rhymes.
- **Assonance Rhyme**: Employs arrays and a phonetic comparison algorithm to suggest rhymes based on vowel sounds.

### Word Sorting
- **Syllable Sorting**: Utilises a custom syllable-counting function to sort words based on syllabic structure, ensuring that suggestions align with the rhythmic needs of the user.
- **Ranking Algorithm**: Implements a bubble sorting algorithm to rank rhymes based on relevance and phonetic quality.

### Data Structures
- **Stacks**: Used for handling masculine rhyme suggestions, ensuring last-in, first-out functionality for rhyme lookup.
- **Arrays**: Applied to store and process assonance rhyme data, providing flexibility in vowel sound comparisons.
- **Linked Lists**: Efficiently manages the rhyme word collection, ensuring smooth access and modification of rhyme suggestions.

### User Interaction
- The application receives input from the user, processes the rhyme request using server-side logic in Node.js, and provides rhyme suggestions.

## Conclusion
- The Poetry Assistant simplifies the process of finding rhymes, whether for casual writing or professional work. By harnessing the power of JavaScript and server-side processing, the project delivers accurate, fast, and intuitive rhyme suggestions. Future enhancements include expanding the algorithm for more nuanced rhyme types and improving performance for larger word datasets.
